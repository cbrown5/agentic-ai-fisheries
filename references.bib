    abstract = {We surveyed 807 researchers (494 ecologists and 313 evolutionary biologists) about their use of Questionable Research Practices (QRPs), including cherry picking statistically significant results, p hacking, and hypothesising after the results are known (HARKing). We also asked them to estimate the proportion of their colleagues that use each of these QRPs. Several of the QRPs were prevalent within the ecology and evolution research community. Across the two groups, we found 64% of surveyed researchers reported they had at least once failed to report results because they were not statistically significant (cherry picking); 42% had collected more data after inspecting whether results were statistically significant (a form of p hacking) and 51% had reported an unexpected finding as though it had been hypothesised from the start (HARKing). Such practices have been directly implicated in the low rates of reproducible results uncovered by recent large scale replication studies in psychology and other disciplines. The rates of QRPs found in this study are comparable with the rates seen in psychology, indicating that the reproducibility problems discovered in psychology are also likely to be present in ecology and evolution.},

abstract = {Abstract Contemporary impacts of anthropogenic climate change on ecosystems are increasingly being recognized. Documenting the extent of these impacts requires quantitative tools for analyses of ecological observations to distinguish climate impacts in noisy data and to understand interactions between climate variability and other drivers of change. To assist the development of reliable statistical approaches, we review the marine climate change literature and provide suggestions for quantitative approaches in climate change ecology. We compiled 267 peer-reviewed articles that examined relationships between climate change and marine ecological variables. Of the articles with time series data (n = 186), 75\% used statistics to test for a dependency of ecological variables on climate variables. We identified several common weaknesses in statistical approaches, including marginalizing other important non-climate drivers of change, ignoring temporal and spatial autocorrelation, averaging across spatial patterns and not reporting key metrics. We provide a list of issues that need to be addressed to make inferences more defensible, including the consideration of (i) data limitations and the comparability of data sets; (ii) alternative mechanisms for change; (iii) appropriate response variables; (iv) a suitable model for the process under study; (v) temporal autocorrelation; (vi) spatial autocorrelation and patterns; and (vii) the reporting of rates of change. While the focus of our review was marine studies, these suggestions are equally applicable to terrestrial studies. Consideration of these suggestions will help advance global knowledge of climate impacts and understanding of the processes driving ecological change.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Recently there has been a growing concern that many published research findings do not hold up in attempts to replicate them. We argue that this problem may originate from a culture of ‘you can publish if you found a significant effect’. This culture creates a systematic bias against the null hypothesis which renders meta-analyses questionable and may even lead to a situation where hypotheses become difficult to falsify. In order to pinpoint the sources of error and possible solutions, we review current scientific practices with regard to their effect on the probability of drawing a false-positive conclusion. We explain why the proportion of published false-positive findings is expected to increase with (i) decreasing sample size, (ii) increasing pursuit of novelty, (iii) various forms of multiple testing and researcher flexibility, and (iv) incorrect P-values, especially due to unaccounted pseudoreplication, i.e. the non-independence of data points (clustered data). We provide examples showing how statistical pitfalls and psychological traps lead to conclusions that are biased and unreliable, and we show how these mistakes can be avoided. Ultimately, we hope to contribute to a culture of ‘you can publish if your study is rigorous’. To this end, we highlight promising strategies towards making science more objective. Specifically, we enthusiastically encourage scientists to preregister their studies (including a priori hypotheses and complete analysis plans), to blind observers to treatment groups during data collection and analysis, and unconditionally to report all results. Also, we advocate reallocating some efforts away from seeking novelty and discovery and towards replicating important research findings of one's own and of others for the benefit of the scientific community as a whole. We believe these efforts will be aided by a shift in evaluation criteria away from the current system which values metrics of ‘impact’ almost exclusively and towards a system which explicitly values indices of scientific rigour.},

abstract = {Summary The two most common approaches for analysing count data are to use a generalized linear model (GLM), or transform data, and use a linear model (LM). The latter has recently been advocated to more reliably maintain control of type I error rates in tests for no association, while seemingly losing little in power. We make three points on this issue. Point 1 – Choice of statistical model should primarily be made on the grounds of data properties. Choice of testing procedure should be considered and addressed as a separate issue, after model choice. If models with the appropriate data properties nonetheless have statistical problems such as type I error control (i.e. type I error rate greatly exceeds the intended significance level), the best solution is to keep the model but fix the problems. Point 2 – When a test has problems with type I error control, it can usually be corrected, but this may require departure from software default approaches. In particular, resampling is a good solution for small samples that can be easy to implement. Point 3 –Tests based on models that better fit the data (e.g. a negative binomial for overdispersed count data) tend to have better power properties and in some instances have considerably higher power. We illustrate these issues for a 2 × 2 experiment with a count response. This seemingly simple problem becomes hard when the experimental design is unbalanced, and software default procedures using LMs or GLMs can have difficulties, although in both cases the issues can be fixed. We conclude that, when GLMs are thought to fit count data well, and when any necessary steps are taken to correct type I error rates, they should be used rather than LMs. Nonetheless, standard LM tests are often robust and can have good type I error control, so there is an argument for their use for counts when diagnostics are difficult and statistical models are complex, although at some risk of loss of power and interpretability.},

With just one zero observation (if this observation represents a sampling unit), the whole data set needs to be fudged by adding a value (usually 1) before transformation. 3. Simulating data from a negative binomial distribution, we compared the outcome of fitting models that were transformed in various ways (log, square root) with results from fitting models using quasi-Poisson and negative binomial models to untransformed count data. 4. We found that the transformations performed poorly, except when the dispersion was small and the mean counts were large. The quasi-Poisson and negative binomial models consistently performed well, with little bias. 5. We recommend that count data should not be analysed by log-transforming it, but instead models based on Poisson and negative binomial distributions should be used.},

Although observational causal inference methodologies exist, predictive techniques such as model selection based on information criterion (e.g. AIC) remains a common approach used to understand ecological relationships. However, predictive approaches are not appropriate for drawing causal conclusions. Here, we highlight the distinction between predictive and causal inference and show how predictive techniques can lead to biased causal estimates. Instead, we encourage ecologists to valid causal inference methods such as the backdoor criterion, a graphical rule that can be used to determine causal relationships across observational studies.},

ABSTRACT = {Information-theoretic (IT) and multi-model averaging (MMA) statistical approaches are widely used but suboptimal tools for pursuing a multifactorial approach (also known as the method of multiple working hypotheses) in ecology. (1) Conceptually, IT encourages ecologists to perform tests on sets of artificially simplified models. (2) MMA improves on IT model selection by implementing a simple form of shrinkage estimation (a way to make accurate predictions from a model with many parameters relative to the amount of data, by “shrinking” parameter estimates toward zero). However, other shrinkage estimators such as penalized regression or Bayesian hierarchical models with regularizing priors are more computationally efficient and better supported theoretically. (3) In general, the procedures for extracting confidence intervals from MMA are overconfident, providing overly narrow intervals. If researchers want to use limited data sets to accurately estimate the strength of multiple competing ecological processes along with reliable confidence intervals, the current best approach is to use full (maximal) statistical models (possibly with Bayesian priors) after making principled, a priori decisions about model complexity.},

If a random sample of their work (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques employed. 2. Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.},

Statistical modeling in ecology faces two major challenges. First, ecological data may not conform to traditional methods, and second, professional ecologists often do not receive extensive statistical training. In response to these challenges, the journal Ecology has published many innovative statistical ecology papers that introduced novel modeling methods and provided accessible guides to statistical best practices. In this paper, we reflect on Ecology's history and its role in the emergence of the subdiscipline of statistical ecology, which we define as the study of ecological systems using mathematical equations, probability, and empirical data. We showcase 36 influential statistical ecology papers that have been published in Ecology over the last century and, in so doing, comment on the evolution of the field. As data and computing power continue to increase, we anticipate continued growth in statistical ecology to tackle complex analyses and an expanding role for Ecology to publish innovative and influential papers, advancing the discipline and guiding practicing ecologists.},

Originating from a discussion at the 2020 International Statistical Ecology Conference, we show how ecologists can build their research following four guiding principles for impactful statistical research practices: (1) define a focussed research question, then plan sampling and analysis to answer it; (2) develop a model that accounts for the distribution and dependence of your data; (3) emphasise effect sizes to replace statistical significance with ecological relevance; and (4) report your methods and findings in sufficient detail so that your research is valid and reproducible. These principles provide a framework for experimental design and reporting that guards against unsound practices. Starting with a well-defined research question allows researchers to create an efficient study to answer it, and guards against poor research practices that lead to poor estimation of the direction, magnitude, and uncertainty of ecological relationships, and to poor replicability. Correct and appropriate statistical models give sound conclusions. Good reporting practices and a focus on ecological relevance make results impactful and replicable. Illustrated with two examples—an experiment to study the impact of disturbance on upland wetlands, and an observational study on blue tit colouring—this paper explains the rationale for the selection and use of effective statistical practices and provides practical guidance for ecologists seeking to improve their use of statistical methods.},

    abstract = {We aimed to demonstrate the importance of establishing best practices in large language model research, using repeat prompting as an illustrative example.Using data from a prior study investigating potential model bias in peer review of medical abstracts, we compared methods that ignore correlation in model outputs from repeated prompting with a random effects method that accounts for this correlation.High correlation within groups was found when repeatedly prompting the model, with intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.69. Ignoring the inherent correlation in the data led to over 100-fold inflation of effective sample size. After appropriately accounting for this issue, the authors’ results reverse from a small but highly significant finding to no evidence of model bias.The establishment of best practices for LLM research is urgently needed, as demonstrated in this case where accounting for repeat prompting in analyses was critical for accurate study conclusions.},

To understand how users perceive, use, and need LLM-based interfaces, we interviewed 30 participants from global academia, industry, and graduate schools. Experts reported more perceived benefts than novices and were more inclined to adopt LLMs in their workfow. We found signifcant diferences between experts and novices in their perceptions, behaviors, and needs for humanAI collaboration. We surfaced a knowledge gap between experts and novices as a possible reason for the beneft gap. We identifed guidance, personalization, and integration as major needs for LLMbased interfaces to support the programming of ABM.},

They can be used for lots of applications, including assistance in code generation tasks. Actual literature lacks an exhaustive analysis of the benefits and drawbacks of using a Large Language Model for the generation of simple and complex code. This paper aims to overcome the issue: we perform a Literature Review to explore the state-of-the-art of the proposed topic, answering 4 Research Questions. Using the PRISMA methodology, we reviewed 66 papers published between 2021 and 2023. Our analysis reveals Python’s dominance as the preferred language and identifies a significant research gap in addressing ethical constraints. Additionally, we provide insights into the performance of models such as GPT-4 and CodeLlama, and their comparative utility in tasks ranging from debugging to multi-turn program synthesis. The findings offer a foundation for future research aimed at optimizing LLMs for code generation.},

By integrating 18 expert-designed tools and using GPT-4 as the LLM, ChemCrow augments the LLM performance in chemistry, and new capabilities emerge. Our agent autonomously planned and executed the syntheses of an insect repellent and three organocatalysts and guided the discovery of a novel chromophore. Our evaluation, including both LLM and expert assessments, demonstrates ChemCrow’s effectiveness in automating a diverse set of chemical tasks.

	abstract = {Large language models and autonomous AI agents have evolved rapidly, resulting in a diverse array of evaluation benchmarks, frameworks and collaboration protocols. However, the landscape remains fragmented and lacks a unified taxonomy or comprehensive survey. Therefore, we present a side-by-side comparison of benchmarks developed between 2019 and 2025 that evaluate these models and agents across multiple domains. In addition, we propose a taxonomy of approximately 60 benchmarks that cover general and academic knowledge reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, code generation and software engineering, factual grounding and retrieval, domain-specific evaluations, multimodal and embodied tasks, task orchestration, and interactive assessments. Furthermore, we review AI-agent frameworks introduced between 2023 and 2025 that integrate large language models with modular toolkits to enable autonomous decision-making and multi-step reasoning. Moreover, we present real-world applications of autonomous AI agents in materials science, biomedical research, academic ideation, software engineering, synthetic data generation, chemical reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, geographic information systems, multimedia, healthcare, and finance. We then survey key agent-to-agent collaboration protocols, namely the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and the Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A). Finally, we discuss recommendations for future research, focusing on advanced reasoning strategies, failure modes in multi-agent LLM systems, automated scientific discovery, dynamic tool integration via reinforcement learning, integrated search capabilities, and security vulnerabilities in agent protocols.},
