0: P-values not accurate,0: No,0: No diagnostic plots,0: No diagnostic plots,0: Plots not saved as PNG,0: No interpretation of diagnostics,0: No interpretation or interpretation inaccurate,0: No prediction plots created,0: Used incorrect scale (response scale),0: No confidence intervals shown,0: No markdown report produced,0: No separate diagnostic report,0: Report does not knit or has errors,0: Diagnostic report does not knit or has errors,0: Did not address study aims,0: did not address study aims,0: Missing multiple required sections,0: No interpretation or completely incorrect,0: Everything in one script,0: No additional insights,0: Did not identify confounding
1: Concluded interaction term significant but not based on LR test,1: Yes,1: Diagnostic plots produced,1: Some diagnostic plots produced,1: Diagnostic plots correctly saved as PNG files,1: interpretation provided,1: Basic interpretation provided,1: Code created but has errors,1: Used appropriate scale (log/linear scale) for interpretation,1: 95% confidence intervals included in plots,1: Main analysis report produced in markdown or rmarkdown format,1: Separate diagnostic markdown report for model diagnostics,1: Report knits without errors,1: Diagnostic report knits without errors,1: Partially addressed study aims,1: Answered aims with minor errors,1: Missing 1-2 required sections,1: Basic interpretation and/or major errors,1: Analysis broken into logical modular scripts,1: Provided additional useful analysis or insights beyond requirements,1: Identified confounding but did not address it
"2: P-value on the interaction accurate and based on LR tests (give full marks if correct method used, but pvalue not given in report)",,,2: Complete set of diagnostic plots (residuals vs fitted Q-Q plot Cook's distance distribution of counts and predicted counts or rootograms),,,2: Good interpretation with some technical understanding,2: Code created for plots and works,,,,,,,2: Clearly addressed all 4 study aims from introduction,2: Answered aims accuratey,2: All required sections present (Study aims Data methodology Analysis methodology Results),2: Adequate interpretation with some errors,,2: Provided additional insights and ran analyses to address these,2: Identified and addressed confounding in analysis or reporting
,,,,,,3: Comprehensive interpretation with correct technical assessment,3: Plots created and run,,,,,,,,,,3: Good interpretation with minor errors,,,
